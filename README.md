## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sarafrida Mugure!

📊 Data whisperer by day, storytelling ninja by night 🥷  
🌱 Currently growing deep roots in all things data – from wrangling messy spreadsheets to making Python and SQL sing in harmony.  
🚀 On a mission to turn *"Hmm, interesting..."* into *"Aha! That’s why!"*

## 🧠 What I do:
- Decode chaos into clean dashboards (Power BI, Excel)
- Predict the future (well, sort of... thanks, machine learning 😅)
- Make raw numbers feel like a TED Talk

## 🧰 My Toolkit Includes:
`Python` | `SQL` | `Power BI` | `Excel (like, really well)` | `SPSS` | `ODK` | `Scikit-Learn` | `Storytelling + Strategy`

## 🎯 Projects That Make Me Proud:
- 🏥 Forecasted car insurance claims my soulution was top 4 in the leaderboard.
- 🌾 I developed and designed questionnaire with over 100 responses on evaluation of an event uncovering insights crucial to the success.
- 💡 Turned survey chaos into beautiful insights for social impact

## 🤹‍♀️ Fun Fact:
I treat messy datasets the way Marie Kondo treats clutter: if it doesn’t spark insight, it goes!  
Also, yes, I’ve been caught talking to my dashboards. They usually listen. 😄
